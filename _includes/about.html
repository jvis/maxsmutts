                <p>We appreciate that your pet is a member of the family and, in addition to love and attention, they need regular exercise.</p>
                <p>Exercise is vital for your dogâ€™s overall health and well-being. Without regular walks your dog is susceptible to common and preventable medical issues such as pet obesity, heart and liver diseases, and osteoarthritis.</p>
                <p>Veterinarians advise that dogs require walking at least once daily to maintain a healthy lifestyle.</p>
